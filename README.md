# ai-for-robotics-notes
These are a set of org mode files that contain my notes for the Udacity 'AI for Robotics' course.  They incorporate LaTeX formatting commands together with R and Python code blocks which are run when the org mode file is compiled to pdf.  Some of the Python code differs slightly from that in the classes in order to generate appropriate output for the pdf document.
